Projects

Best Buy CRUD Database Console: SQL | C# | .NET Core
* The BestBuy database simulates an inventory management system and employee sales records
* Implemented a repository pattern to isolate the data access logic and business logic in order to allow for a more loosely coupled approach to data access from a sample BestBuy database
* Demonstrated CRUD operations through a console user interface
* Optimized SQL Code as necessary while monitoring and maintaining database storage resources. Install database software service packs and cumulative updates as necessary.

KanyeREST: C# | .NET Core| JSON | API
* This program will simulate a conversation between Kanye West and Ron Swanson through API calls
* using the Newtonsoft.JSON NuGet package the program will make a call to the Kanye URL and parse the JSON object into a string called kanyeQuote
* The application makes a call to the Ron Swanson API and parses the JSON Array into a string called swansonQuote
* The program will “chat” using a loop to simulate the two talking back and forth until the loop finishes execution

Tacobell Geolocator: C# | .NET Core | SQL | xUnit 
* Uses a CSV file or a SQL database to populate an IEnumerable<Tacobell> called locations
* Test-Driven Development using xUnit ensures that invalid or missing data is handled correctly 
* If the data is out of bounds or cannot be parsed, then the parse method returns null. 
* Finally, utilizing the Geolocator NuGet package, the program will calculate the two farthest Tacobells
